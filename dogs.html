<h2>These are my Dogs:</h2>
    <p>These are my Poodle mix dogs. They are 9 years old but they still look like puppies. They were born on Jun 26th, my wife has had them since they were born and I met them when they turned 6.
    The small one on the left is named Daisy, and the one on the right is named Lobo (wolf in spanish) but we call him Bobo because he is extremley clumsy.
