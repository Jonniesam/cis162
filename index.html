            My name is Jonnie Samaniego, I have a B.A. in Sociology but wanted to purse a degree in CIS. I have been self taught for about a year but wanted to receive a certification and degree in CS. CS is very facinating to me, and I have used the Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, and Codecademy in order to teach myself.
            I have a cousin who is in the industry and he was the push that I needed in order to continue forward. I did not want to go through a bootcamp, so I am starting my journey here.
